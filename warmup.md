  - testing

take-home
- ways it could be better
  - When I finished to read the Notion I review my code and I understand that I did't make more suitable solution following the Joel Test.
  - Add tests about the functions that I made.
  - Try to follow single responsibility principle to simplified my tests
  - I believe that this improvements about code go to the follow with CORE VALUES
